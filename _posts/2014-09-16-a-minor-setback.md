title: A minor setback
---

Last Monday (9/8/2014) my main development machine suffered a pretty traumatic crash. The hard drive was completely unresponsive and would not come back to life. No mater how much I wished it.

Unfortunately I lost a couple of days of tinkering.  Nothing too dramatic, but enough that I had to go and reread a lot of my comments and notes from the previous days to get it back to where I *think* it was on 9/8. I have not committed this build as of this writing but I should soon.

I spent the last few days getting another development machine in working condition as well as taking care of my day job. I am almost back to normal and should be able to resume normal development in the following days.

Unfortunately I am now about 10 days behind where I wanted to be in this release milestone. I am pushing back the release date until the end of October. Hopefully I don't introduce any [bugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Problem) on this famous day.

Keep a watchful eye on the repository and look for a tagged build.
